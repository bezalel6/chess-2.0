## üî¨ Research Summary

### Libraries Selected

| Library | Purpose | Version | Trust Score |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **chess.js** | Game logic | ^1.0.0 | 8.8/10 |
| **chessground** | Board UI | ^9.0.0 | 9.2/10 |
| **stockfish.js** | AI engine | 10.0.2 | 8.8/10 |

### Why These Libraries?

**chess.js:**
- ‚úÖ TypeScript-native with excellent type definitions
- ‚úÖ Complete chess rules (castling, en passant, promotion)
- ‚úÖ Move validation and generation
- ‚úÖ FEN/PGN support
- ‚úÖ No AI (we use Stockfish separately for flexibility)

**chessground:**
- ‚úÖ Battle-tested (powers lichess.org)
- ‚úÖ Highly performant (60fps+ on mobile)
- ‚úÖ Configurable and themeable
- ‚úÖ Mobile-friendly with touch support
- ‚úÖ No chess logic (perfect separation of concerns)

**stockfish.js:**
- ‚úÖ WASM implementation (fast, native performance)
- ‚úÖ UCI protocol support
- ‚úÖ Multiple strength levels
- ‚úÖ Multi-PV analysis (top N moves)
- ‚úÖ Well-documented and maintained

**Alternative Considered:** `svelte-chess` (complete package)
- ‚ùå Less flexibility for custom challenge system
- ‚ùå Bundles everything together
- ‚úÖ Good for standard chess apps

## üìä Architecture Highlights

### Data Flow
```
Player Move ‚Üí Validation (chess.js) ‚Üí Update State ($state)
                                            ‚Üì
                                 Trigger Analysis (async)
                                            ‚Üì
                          Stockfish (Web Worker, non-blocking)
                                            ‚Üì
                    Generate Challenge ‚Üê Parse Analysis
                                            ‚Üì
                          Display Challenge & Await Response
                                            ‚Üì
                    Evaluate Move ‚Üí Calculate Score ‚Üí Update UI
```

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Svelte 5 Runes for reactive state
let chess = $state(new Chess());
let fen = $derived(chess.fen());
let legalMoves = $derived.by(() => chess.moves({ verbose: true }));

$effect(() => {
  // Side effect: trigger analysis when position changes
  if (fen) analyzePosition(fen);
});
```

### Performance Strategy
- **Web Worker:** Stockfish runs in background (no UI freeze)
- **Lazy Loading:** Load Stockfish on first analysis request
- **Memoization:** Cache legal moves per position
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Quick ‚Üí Deep analysis
- **Debouncing:** Wait 500ms after move before analysis

## üéÆ Core Features

### 1. Chess Game Engine
- Full FIDE rules implementation
- Legal move validation with highlighting
- Special moves: castling, en passant, promotion
- Check/checkmate/stalemate detection
- Move history with algebraic notation
- Undo/redo functionality

### 2. Challenge System
**6 Challenge Types:**
1. **Best Move** - Find the absolute best move (always available)
2. **Best Piece Move** - Best move with specific piece (e.g., knight)
3. **Defensive Move** - Best defensive response (when under attack)
4. **Attacking Move** - Best attacking opportunity (when winning)
5. **Tactical Move** - Spot tactical opportunity (large eval swing)
6. **Positional Move** - Improve position (quiet positions)

**Scoring:**
- Exact match: 100 points √ó difficulty
- Close alternative (top-3): 60 points √ó difficulty
- Reasonable move (<200cp): 20 points
- Poor move: -10 points
- Streak bonus: +10 per streak level

### 3. AI Analysis (Stockfish)
- Depth 15 analysis (3-5 seconds)
- Multi-PV 5 (top 5 moves)
- 2 threads for performance
- Position evaluation in centipawns
- Principal variation (best line)

### 4. Statistics & Tracking
- Total score with breakdown
- Current streak with üî• indicator
- Challenge completion rate
- Success rate by challenge type
- Average accuracy
- Points per challenge type

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Svelte 5 Runes over Svelte Stores:** Better TypeScript support, simpler API
2. **Chessground over React Chessboard:** Framework-agnostic, proven performance
3. **Web Worker for Stockfish:** Prevents UI blocking during analysis
4. **Client-side only (MVP):** Reduces complexity, faster iteration
5. **Tailwind CSS v4:** Modern utility-first approach, great DX

### Known Limitations (MVP)
- No user accounts (local state only)
- No multiplayer (single-player only)
- No game persistence across sessions
- No custom challenge creation
- No opening repertoire training
- No puzzle mode

These are planned for future phases (6-9).

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Stockfish not loading
- **Solution:** Check CDN availability, use local copy as fallback

**Issue:** Board not rendering
- **Solution:** Ensure chessground CSS is imported in `app.css`

**Issue:** Type errors with chess.js
- **Solution:** Install types: `bun add -d @types/chess.js`

**Issue:** Performance issues on mobile
- **Solution:** Reduce Stockfish depth to 12, use single thread
